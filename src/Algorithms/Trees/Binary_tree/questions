Problem-17  Given two binary trees, return true if they are structurally identical.
Solution: Algorithm:
         • If both trees are NULL then return true.
         • If both trees are not NULL, then compare data and recursively check left and right
         subtree structures.

Problem-32  How many different binary trees are possible with n nodes?
Solution:
For example, consider a tree with 3 nodes (n = 3).
It will have the maximum combination of 5 different (i.e., 23 -3 = 5) trees.
In general, if there are n nodes, there exist (2^n - n) different trees.
