Problem-14
How do we implement two stacks using only one array? Our stack routines
should not indicate an exception unless every slot in the array is used?

Solution
Algorithm:
• Start two indexes one at the left end and the other at the right end.
• The left index simulates the first stack and the right index simulates the second stack.
• If we want to push an element into the first stack then put the element at the left index.
• Similarly, if we want to push an element into the second stack then put the element at the right index.
• The first stack grows towards the right, and the second stack grows towards the left.
Time Complexity of push and pop for both stacks is O(1). Space Complexity is O(1).

Problem-17
Multiple (m) stacks in one array: Similar to Problem-15, what if we want to implement m stacks in one array?

Solution:
Let us assume that array indexes are from 1 to n. Similar to the discussion in Problem- 15, to implement m stacks in one array, we divide the array into m parts (as shown below). The
size of each part is .
